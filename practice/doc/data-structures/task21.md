# Java Programming: Java Collections

## Challenge: TreeSet: Exercise

We are given an ArrayList that contains `Employee` objects. We need to print the following details:

### Problem Statements

#### Problem 1: Numbers greater than 50

Given an array of numbers, find all the numbers that are greater than 50.

#### Problem 2: Smallest and largest number in array

Given an array of numbers, find the smallest and the largest number in the array.

## Task steps

1. Put your program here: `com.github.akarazhev.jacademy.practice.jprog.task21` in the `TreeSetExercise1..2` classes;
2. Write a meaningful message with a commit and push the code;
3. Show the result to a mentor.
