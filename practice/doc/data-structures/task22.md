# Java Programming: Java Collections

## Challenge: Let's solve some HashMap practice problems.

We are given a HashMap which contains stock data.

### Problem Statements

#### Problem 1: Find the highest stock price

Find the company with the highest stock price.

#### Problem 2: Find the average stock price

Find the average stock price of all the companies.

#### Problem 3: Remove companies with stock price below 50.

Remove all the companies that have a stock price of fewer than 50 dollars.

## Task steps

1. Put your program here: `com.github.akarazhev.jacademy.practice.jprog.task22` in the `HashMapDemo1..3` classes;
2. Write a meaningful message with a commit and push the code;
3. Show the result to a mentor.
