# Java Programming: Java Collections

## Challenge: Let's work on a HashSet exercise.

### Problem Statement

#### Problem: Find duplicate element

You are given an array in which all the elements are unique except one element. You need to find the duplicate element.

For example, the array is {12, 34, 1, 56, 43, 34, 65}

The output should be 34 since it is the only duplicate element.

This problem should be done in O(n) complexity, and the array is not sorted.

## Task steps

1. Put your program here: `com.github.akarazhev.jacademy.practice.jprog.task20` in the `HashSetExercise` classe;
2. Write a meaningful message with a commit and push the code;
3. Show the result to a mentor.

## Quiz

1. What order are the elements in a HashSet stored?

A) Insertion Order

B) Sorted Order

C) Random Order

2. Does HashSet allow null elements?

A) Yes, but only one null element.

B) No.

C) Any number of null elements can be added.

3. A HashSet is backed by which Collection?

A) ArrayList

B) HashMap

C) TreeMap

D) LinkedList
