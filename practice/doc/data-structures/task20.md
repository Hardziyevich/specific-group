# Java Programming: Java Collections

## Challenge: Let's work on a HashSet exercise.

### Problem Statement

#### Problem: Find duplicate element

You are given an array in which all the elements are unique except one element. You need to find the duplicate element.

For example, the array is {12, 34, 1, 56, 43, 34, 65}

The output should be 34 since it is the only duplicate element.

This problem should be done in O(n) complexity, and the array is not sorted.

## Task steps

1. Put your program here: `com.github.akarazhev.jacademy.practice.jprog.task20` in the `HashSetExercise` classe;
2. Write a meaningful message with a commit and push the code;
3. Show the result to a mentor.
