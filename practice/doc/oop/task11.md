## Challenge: Override a Method using the Super Keyword

Can you Implement the Derived Class function by using the Base Class functions?

### Problem Statement

When a method in a derived class overrides a method in a base class, it is still possible to call the overridden 
method using the `super` keyword.

> If you write super.method(), it will call the method that was defined in the superclass.

You are given a partially completed code in the editor. The class `Shape` is the base class of the `XShape` class. 
You have to modify the `getName()` method of the derived class, i.e `XShape`, so that the code returns the following:

### Input

Derived Class Name

### Output

Base Class Name, Derived Class Name

### Sample Input

```java
Shape circle = new XShape("Circle");
```

### Sample Output

`
"Shape, Circle"
`
