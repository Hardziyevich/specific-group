## Challenge: Implement the Derived Class

Can you Implement the Derived Class function by using the Base Class functions?

### Problem Statement

Implement a function `getDetails(String carName)` of the <b>Derived Class</b> `Car` which takes a string `carName` and 
appends it with model, name, and speed. We have already implemented the <b>Base Class</b> `Vehicle` with 
the member functions `getModel()` and `getSpeed()` which return the model and speed of the car respectively.

### Input

Car Name

### Output

Car Name, Model, Speed

### Sample Input

`
"Roadster";
`

### Sample Output

`
"Roadster, Tesla, 100";
`
