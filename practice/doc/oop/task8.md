## Challenge: Implement a Calculator Class

In this exercise, you have to implement a calculator which can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division.

### Problem Statement

Write a Java <b>class</b> called `Calculator` with
- `private` <i>fields</i>:
    - `num1` and `num2` (<b>double</b> type)

And methods:
- `add()`, a <i>method</i> which returns the addition of two numbers
- `subtract()`, a <i>method</i> which returns the subtraction of num1 from num2
- `multiply()`, a <i>method</i> which returns the multiplication of numbers
- `divide()`, a <i>method</i> which returns the division of num2 by num1
- Define a parameterized constructor which takes two parameters `num1` and `num2` and assigns these variables to 
  the respective fields in the class.

### Input

Pass double point numbers in the parameterized constructor

### Output

addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication

### Sample Input

```java
final Calculator obj = new Calculator(10, 94);
obj.add()
obj.subtract()
obj.multiply()
obj.divide()
```

### Sample Output

`
104
84
940
9.4
`

## Task steps

1. Put your program here: `com.github.akarazhev.jacademy.practice.jprog.task8` in the `Calculator` class;
2. Write a meaningful message with a commit and push the code;
3. Show the result to a mentor;
4. Answer some questions.
