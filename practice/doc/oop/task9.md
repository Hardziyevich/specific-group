## Challenge: Implement the Rectangle Class Using Encapsulation

Can you implement the rectangle class using the concepts of encapsulation?

### Problem Statement

You are given a partially completed code of a Rectangle class in the editor. Add two fields i.e. length and width 
and modify the default and parametrized constructors which assign parameters to the length and width fields of 
the Rectangle class. In the end, Implement the getArea() method which returns the area of the rectangle.

### Input

Calls the constructor by passing length and width.
Calls the `getArea()` method to return the area.

### Output

Returns the area of a rectangle.

### Sample Input

```java
Rectangle obj = new Rectangle(2, 2);
```

### Sample Output

`
4
`
