# Java Programming: basics

The code snip below has some Python code that prints a quotation from a well-known novel. 
Write a Java program that prints the same output. It’s ok if you don’t know Python – you should be able to see the intent 
of the code by running it. A few things to note:
- Every Java program needs a class and a main method;
- Python concatenates adjacent string literals. If you want to split the long line into multiple lines, 
  you’ll need to concatenate several strings, as done in the sample solution.
- Python’s print statement automatically prints a newline; `System.out.println` is the equivalent.

```python
# Python code to print some dialog from a novel.
        print('"Good," said the boy, for he had no wish '
        'to tell the secret to his playmates, '
        'liking to know and do what they knew not and could not.')
```

## Task steps

1. Put your program here: `com.github.akarazhev.jacademy.practice.jprog.task2` in the `Ged` class;
2. Write a meaningful message with a commit and push the code;
3. Add comments where they are needed;
4. Show the result to a mentor.
