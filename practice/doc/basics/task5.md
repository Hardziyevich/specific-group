# Java Programming: basics

To practice writing boolean expressions that test if a variable satisfies several conditions, complete the function 
`evenInRange` below so that the function returns true if the parameter `x` is an even number in the range 24...32 
(inclusive of the values 24 and 32). You should only need to write a single line of code.

## Task steps

1. Put your program here: `com.github.akarazhev.jacademy.practice.jprog.task5` in the `EvenInRange` class;
2. Write a meaningful message with a commit and push the code;
3. Add comments where they are needed;
4. Show the result to a mentor.
