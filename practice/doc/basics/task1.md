# Java Programming: basics

Write a program that prints out the text:

>Hello, hello.
> 
>I don't know why you say goodbye.
> 
>I say hello.

You’ll need a class name that matches the name of the file, a `main` function (don’t forget the `public static void` or 
the required parameters), and a few `println` calls. 

## Task steps

1. Put your program here: `com.github.akarazhev.jacademy.practice.jprog.task1` in the `Beatles` class;
2. Add comments where they are needed;
3. Write a meaningful message with a commit and push the code;
4. Show the result to a mentor;
5. Answer some questions.
