# Java Programming: basics

<b>Objective</b>: Create and use values and variables of the `double` type.

Declare and give initial values to variables `r` and `pi` representing the radius of a circle, 
and an approximation of the mathematical constant Ï€. 
Use those values to compute and print the area of the circle. You can square a number in Java by multiplying it by itself.

Notice from the sample solution that you can declare multiple variables of the same type using a single line of code.

## Task steps
