# Java Programming: basics

<b>Objective</b>: Create and use values and variables of the `double` type.

Declare and give initial values to variables `r` and `pi` representing the radius of a circle, 
and an approximation of the mathematical constant Ï€. 
Use those values to compute and print the area of the circle. You can square a number in Java by multiplying it by itself.

Notice from the sample solution that you can declare multiple variables of the same type using a single line of code.

## Task steps

1. Put your program here: `com.github.akarazhev.jacademy.practice.jprog.task3` in the `CircleArea` class;
2. Add comments where they are needed;
3. Write a meaningful message with a commit and push the code;
4. Show the result to a mentor;
5. Answer some questions.
