Math, and Logic in Java.

Next, you learned how classes and objects can help you create simple, efficient, reusable, and secure code.

Then you explored the power of recursion and multithreading in Java and saw how they can be used to perform complex 
tasks easily and time efficiently.

Lastly, you familiarized yourself with the latest features of Java 8, like lambda functions and stream API.
