# Mutex vs Semaphore

Intention: The concept of and the difference between a mutex and a semaphore will draw befuddled expressions on most 
developers' faces. We discuss the differences between the two most fundamental concurrency constructs offered by 
almost all language frameworks. Difference between a mutex and a semaphore makes a pet interview question for 
senior engineering positions!
