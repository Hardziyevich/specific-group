# Composition

Intention: In this chapter, you'll learn how to achieve composition in Java.

Composition is the practice of creating other class objects in your class. In such a scenario, the class which creates 
the object of the other class is known as the owner and is responsible for the lifetime of that object.

Composition relationships are Part-of relationships where the part must constitute part of the whole object. 
We can achieve composition by adding smaller parts of other classes to make a complex unit.

So, what makes the composition so unique?

In composition, the lifetime of the owned object depends on the lifetime of the owner.

# Example

A car is composed of an engine, tires, and doors. In this case, a Car owns these objects so a Car is an Owner class and 
tires,doors and engine classes are Owned classes.

# Implementation

Letâ€™s look at the implementation of Car class for better understanding:

```java

```

We have created a Car class which contains the objects of Engine, Tires and Doors classes. The Car class is responsible 
for the lifetime of the owned objects, i.e., when the Car dies, so does the tires, engine and doors.
