# A First Java Program

Intention: Learn the basic structure of a Java program.

## Java Program

```java
public final class FirstProgram {

    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        // Print the word:
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

First things to note:

1. Single-line comments begin with //;
2. The method main is defined using the keywords public static void. The method named main is special: Java starts running 
   the code at the first line of the method named main;
3. Method definitions are grouped into classes;
5. Most lines of code end in a semi-colon. Method and class definitions do not.
