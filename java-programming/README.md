# Java Programming

Java is one of the most sought after and widely used programming languages in the tech industry, and will continue to be 
for the foreseeable future. It runs on everything from phones to game consoles to data centers. This project will teach you 
to program on the java language. 

Learning Objectives:
- Get adapted to Java syntax and behavior;
- Practice using OOP techniques in Java;
- Explore Lambdas and Stream APIs;
- Get your hands dirty writing and running real Java code off the bat;
- Gain a mastery of multithreading and concurrency concepts;
- Learn to write effective unit tests with JUnit 5.

## Basics of Java Programming

The module describes Java syntax and shows code examples. Cover static methods, variables, strings, arrays, and loops.

Module Objectives:
- Learn to work with variables of different data types;
- Learn to define and use functions;
- Learn to write programs that use conditional logic;
- Learn to repeat parts of a program using loops.

1. [Introduction](doc/basics/introduction.md "Introduction") - Introduction;
2. [First Java Program](doc/basics/first-program.md "First Java Program") - A First Java Program;
3. [Printing to the screen](doc/basics/screen-printing.md "Printing to the screen") - Printing to the screen;
4. [Variables; integer values with 'int'](doc/basics/variables.md "Variables; integer values with 'int'") - 
   Variables; integer values with 'int';
5. [Arithmetic expressions and operators](doc/basics/arithmetic-exp-op.md "Arithmetic expressions and operators") -
   Arithmetic expressions and operators;
6. [Method parameters and return values](doc/basics/method-params.md "Method parameters and return values") -

11. [Loops](doc/basics/loops.md "Loops") - while, for, foreach loops.

## Object-Oriented Programming

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm popular for large and complex systems. In this module, 
dive deep into how OOP works in Java. Learn to write cleaner, more reusable code using OOP principles.

Module Objectives:
- Learn what object orientation means;
- Learn the basic tenets of OOP;
- Learn how to implement abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, aggregation and composition in Java.

Chapters:
1. [Introduction](doc/oop/introduction.md "Introduction to Classes") - Introduction to Classes;
2. [Declaration and Implementation](doc/oop/decl-impl.md "Declaration and Implementation") - Declaration and Implementation;

## Recursion

Learn how recursion can help you solve a variety of different math, string, and data structure problems by using 
interactive code playgrounds.

Module Objectives:
- Learn about recursion and its various types;
- Learn to apply recursion to problems involving Java's built-in data types;
- Learn recursive problem-solving with data structures.

## Java Multithreading

Explore multithreading and concurrency concepts in Java, from the basics on upward.

Module Objectives:
- Learn the concept of a thread in programming;
- Learn what multi-threaded programs are and how to implement one in Java;
- Learn about the memory model for multi-threading in Java;
- Learn about challenges in multi-threaded programs and their solution techniques in Java.

## Java Collections

Collections is one of the most important topics for Java Programming. Without the proper knowledge of every collection 
type in Java, it becomes difficult for you to decide which option to pick in a particular scenario.  

This course will give you a great understanding of all collection types available in the Collections Framework like lists, 
linked lists, sets, and hashmaps.  

After completing this course, you will know how data can be modified within a collection, how to sort a collection, 
and how it can be made thread-safe. You will also cover the internal working of each Java collection so you can work with 
them more efficiently.

Module Objectives:
- Master the use of common collections in Java;
- Learn how to choose the right collection for your Java program.

## Features

Learn about Lambdas, Java Stream API, as well as lots of other new improvements made in Java 8.

Module Objectives
- Learn how to write Lambda functions in Java 8;
- Master the use of Java 8 Stream and Time APIs;
- Learn about the improved collections in Java 8;
- Learn about Java 8's concurrency features.

## Clean Code

Clean Code is a key to a better, performant, efficient software system.  For almost all software products, 
except very tiny ones, there will be lots of code and some of them will be indeed bad code.
Over time developer teams will change, technologies will change, viewpoints to certain patterns will change and at 
the end of the day, some code will be bad code. So there is no way to guarantee that source code of a software product 
will be of only clean code. But there are some golden rules that experienced developer should always have in mind when 
coding. In this blog I am going to go through some important smells and heuristics of refactoring with java examples.

Chapters:
1. [Naming](doc/cleancode/naming.md "The naming chapter")
2. [Functions](doc/cleancode/functions.md "The functions chapter")
3. [Comments](doc/cleancode/comments.md "The comments chapter")
