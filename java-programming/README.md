# Java Programming

Java is one of the most sought after and widely used programming languages in the tech industry, 
and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. It runs on everything from phones to game consoles to data centers. 
This module will teach you to program on the java language. 

## Modules And Chapters

Basics of Java Programming:

Object-Oriented Programming:

Recursion:

Java Multithreading:

Java Collections:

Features:

Clean Code:

Clean Code is a key to a better, performant, efficient software system.
For almost all software products, except very tiny ones, there will be lots of code and some of them will be indeed bad code.
Over time developer teams will change, technologies will change, viewpoints to certain patterns will change and at the end of the day,
some code will be bad code. So there is no way to guarantee that source code of a software product will be of only clean code.
But there are some golden rules that experienced developer should always have in mind when coding.
In this blog I am going to go through some important smells and heuristics of refactoring with java examples.
