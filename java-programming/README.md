## Java Collections

Collections is one of the most important topics for Java Programming. Without the proper knowledge of every collection 
type in Java, it becomes difficult for you to decide which option to pick in a particular scenario.  

This course will give you a great understanding of all collection types available in the Collections Framework like lists, 
linked lists, sets, and hashmaps.  

After completing this course, you will know how data can be modified within a collection, how to sort a collection, 
and how it can be made thread-safe. You will also cover the internal working of each Java collection so you can work with 
them more efficiently.

Module Objectives:
- Master the use of common collections in Java;
- Learn how to choose the right collection for your Java program.

## Clean Code

Clean Code is a key to a better, performant, efficient software system.  For almost all software products, 
except very tiny ones, there will be lots of code and some of them will be indeed bad code.
Over time developer teams will change, technologies will change, viewpoints to certain patterns will change and at 
the end of the day, some code will be bad code. So there is no way to guarantee that source code of a software product 
will be of only clean code. But there are some golden rules that experienced developer should always have in mind when 
coding. In this blog I am going to go through some important smells and heuristics of refactoring with java examples.
